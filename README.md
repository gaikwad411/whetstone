## Whetstone

A personal technology practice lab.

This repository is where I deliberately sharpen my understanding of backend systems, APIs, authentication mechanisms, messaging patterns, and cloud-native tooling.

The intent is not to build production software here, but to:

Explore technologies in isolation

Compare architectural approaches

Understand trade-offs

Practice implementation patterns

Document learnings clearly

Like a whetstone sharpens a blade, this repository sharpens engineering judgment.

**Structure**

Each folder focuses on a single concept or technology. Examples include:

REST implementations (FastAPI, Flask, DRF)

GraphQL

SOAP

OAuth2 / OIDC / SAML

Messaging (RabbitMQ, Pub/Sub)

Containerization (Docker)

Kubernetes manifests
